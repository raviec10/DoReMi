 A top up can be added only when a subscription exists.

Renewal Reminder
 Once a user subscribes to a plan, the user needs to be notified 10 days before the plan expires. 

Goal
 Given a date when the subscription starts, your program should print: 
 

 The date on which the reminder should be sent for each subscription category 
 The total amount for renewal. Renewal amount is the sum of all the subscription plan amount and top up amount. 
 ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Aim to get the Readability and Correctness (I/O) badges - your profile can go forward with most companies with those 2 badges. The rest can be improved upon later! 

Assumptions
